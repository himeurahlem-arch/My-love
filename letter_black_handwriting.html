  <h1>Where skies meet earth</h1>

  <p>Everything began where skies meet earth, at a place only our paths could cross. The day of the golden gate, when two worlds descended into one, is etched in a number that only hearts remember.</p>

  <p>Since then, the map of us has been drawn in secret coordinates: whispers of 36•69 north, 3•21 east, guiding us through hidden doors, through corridors only we dared to explore. Every step, every laugh, every stolen kiss was a key.</p>

  <p>Some moments felt like eclipses, a silence lasting just long enough to remind us of the light we carry together. <span class="highlight">Flames of rivers echo, valleys embrace real understanding silently.</span></p>

  <p>There are paths marked by numbers, little mysteries: 3•5 steps along roads forbidden to all but us, and yet I loved every one. Golden fragments of us — AU, locked in the invisible chest of hearts — shine quietly behind every glance, every touch, every sigh.</p>

  <p>Even the calendar bends to us: a day numbered 17•09 approaches, and though the world moves on, the map of us holds it secret. I give you this now, before the sun reaches that mark, so the memory belongs first to us.</p>

  <p>Each laugh, each embrace, each whisper is a star in the universe only we inhabit. When you touch me, when your hands and eyes find me, the world falls away, and I am carried to places no one else can take me. Every moment with you is ours alone, every sigh, every glance, every spark — I adore them all, and I adore you, entirely, completely, endlessly.</p>

  <p><span class="highlight">I long for the day I am yours entirely, to give you all of me, to build a life only with you, to carry our love into the future, with children and hearts bound together forever.</span></p>
